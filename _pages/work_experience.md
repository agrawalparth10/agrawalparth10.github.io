## Work Experience 
### Undergraduate Research Assistant, Vision Lab (May'21 – June'22) 
  * Advised by Dr. Alex Wong and Dr. Stefano Soatto
  * Interested in 3D vision and adversarial robustness
  * Proposed a framework to optimize a single set of adversarial perturbations from a dataset for stereo matching networks generalizable across networks and datasets which can increase D1 error of state-of-the-art stereo networks from 1% to approximately 87%.
  * Investigating architectural defenses to improve robustness of networks to adversarial perturbations by 60.5%. 
  * Exploring networks for removing outliers from sparse depth maps generated using lidar


### Undergraduate Research Assistant, Laboratory for Embedded Machines and Ubiquitous Robots (July'20 – April'21)
  *	Advised by Dr. Ankur Mehta.
  *	Tested 433 MHz LoRa, 2.4 GHz ESP32 WIFI, BLE, and 2.4 GHz NRF24l01 modules on latency and signal strength for communication with the blimp.
  *	Developed communication pipeline for manual control of lighter than air vehicles using ESP8266 microcontrollers and ESP Now protocol in python and C++. 
  *	Deployed on-device random forest and fully connected neural network models for image classification on ESP32 microcontrollers using TensorFlow lite.
  *	Implemented on-device monocular depth estimation on ESP EYE microcontroller. [Website](https://uclalemur.com/people/parth-agrawal) [Blogpost](https://uclalemur.com/blog/tag:foray)

### Computer Vision Intern, Tata Singapore Airlines (July’20 – September’20)
  *	Explored State-of-the-Art Face Recognition architectures for face recognition as part of DigiYatra, a Government of India program.

### Software Engineering Intern, Fuzzy Logix (July'19 – August'19)
  *	Created framework to detect fraudulent transactions using graph algorithms. 
  *	Developed stored procedures in SQL to preprocess data, apply graph algorithms, and visualize the network.

### Kiosk Manager and Web Developer, UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame (October'19 – June'20)
  * Provided technical support to the UCLA Athletics, Hall of Fame and maintained kiosk applications. 
  *	Actively fixed bugs, added test cases, and maintained database of student athletes using shell scripts, MySQL, and Swift. 
  *	Initiated the transition from legacy code to Swift 5. 


## Student Organizations

### Analyst, Bruin Ventures (September'19 – June'22)
  * Performed competitive market analysis, suggested UI/UX improvements, and recommended APIs for a healthcare administration and automation startup. 
  * Researched digital marketing and developed market entry strategies for a mid-sized event planning startup. Identified target audience and made targeted market expansion plans for each type of event. 
  * Acted as a project leader to develop product roadmap and performed SWOT analyses for an energy efficiency startup.
  * Analyzed companies to form potential partnerships for a health tech startup. Determined different use cases for the company’s API suite. Developed python scripts to clean datasets. [Website](https://www.uclabv.com/)
