### MicroImage Library

* Created an on-device image processing library for microcontrollers in C++. 
* The library can apply sobel, prewitt, and average filter on grayscale images. [Link](https://github.com/agrawalparth10/micro-image-processing)

### Mosaic Generator

* Created a framework to generate mosaic images using K-means clustering using numpy in python. [Link](https://github.com/agrawalparth10/mosaic_images)
  
### ECG

* Applied the technique of knowledge distillation to train a student shallow CNN from a teacher CNN – BiLSTM network for electroencephalography 4 class motor classification using PyTorch.
* Teacher network achieved test accuracy of 51% and student network achieved test accuracy of 33%. [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G1uq__BA4Vumhl7F0nL0UXjjxYrdn7o_?usp=sharing)

### Covid Forecasting

* Explored XGBoost, LSTM, BiLSTM, and ARIMA for COVID prediction time series problem using PyTorch and scikit-learn. 
* The best model had Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 2.269. 
  
### BioFaceNet-PyTorch

* Converted the original BioFaceNet implementation from MATLAB to PyTorch.
* BioFaceNet is deep CNN that learns to decompose a single face image into melanin, haemoglobin, diffuse shading, specular shading, and albedo maps. [Link](https://github.com/agrawalparth10/BioFaceNet-PyTorch)

### Contactless Heart Rate Monitor 

* Reimplemented research paper for contactless heart rate monitor 
* Image processing, ICA, Fourier Transformation, and band-pass filtering were performed on the user’s face to measure pulse using the principle of photoplethysmography with an error rate of ± 10 bpm under adequate lighting conditions using OpenCV and Scikit-learn. [Link](https://github.com/agrawalparth10/Heart-Rate-Monitor)

### Kaggle Prostate Cancer Detection 

* Trained an ensemble model of EfficientNets – B0 and B1 – on GPU to label biopsy slides with the ISUP grading system using PyTorch with a test accuracy of 0.87 quadratic weighted kappa.

### File encryption using face recognition

* Designed and developed face recognition programs to encrypt and decrypt files using OpenCV and Scikit-learn. 
* Used ResNet 10 SSD architecture to detect faces, FaceNet architecture to create 128D embeddings for each user from a sparse dataset of 5-6 images, and SVM for classification. [Link](https://github.com/agrawalparth10/Face-is-the-Key)

### Transfer Learning using DeepMimic

* Used DeepMimic to transfer learn different gaits of a humanoid for the ECE 239AS: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning class project. 
* Investigated the convergence of training networks from scratch and finetuning pretrained models. [Link](https://agrawalparth10.github.io/files/RL_Presentation_Poster.pdf)
  
### Numpy Deep Learning Framework

* Completed CS 231 assignments to build a deep learning framework from scratch using Numpy.
  
### LED Lighting System

* Build a lighting system for my dorm room controlled using IR from my phone.
* Programmed Arduino Uno board in C++.

### Line-following Robot
* Built a line following car using TI microcontroller for ECE 3: Introduction to Electrical Engineering class project
* Implemented PID control in C++. [Link](https://youtu.be/Ul8CYeJgUpY)
