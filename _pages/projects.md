Projects
======

MicroImage Library
======
* Created an on-device image processing library for microcontrollers in C++. 
* The library can apply sobel, prewitt, and average filter on grayscale images.

Mosaic Generator
======
* Created a framework to generate mosaic images using K-means clustering using numpy in python. 
  
ECG
======
* Applied the technique of knowledge distillation to train a student shallow CNN from a teacher CNN – BiLSTM network for electroencephalography 4 class motor classification using PyTorch.
* Teacher network achieved test accuracy of 51% and student network achieved test accuracy of 33%

Covid Forecasting
======
* Explored XGBoost, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and ARIMA for COVID prediction time series problem using PyTorch and scikit-learn. 
* The best model had Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 2.269.
  
BioFaceNet-PyTorch
======
* Converted the original BioFaceNet implementation from MATLAB to PyTorch.
* BioFaceNet is deep CNN that learns to decompose a single face image into melanin, haemoglobin, diffuse shading, specular shading, and albedo maps.

Contactless Heart Rate Monitor 
======
* Reimplemented research paper for contactless heart rate monitor 
* Image processing, ICA, Fourier Transformation, and band-pass filtering were performed on the user’s face to measure pulse using the principle of photoplethysmography with an error rate of &pm 10 bpm under adequate lighting conditions using OpenCV and Scikit-learn

Kaggle Prostate Cancer Detection 
======
* Trained an ensemble model of EfficientNets – B0 and B1 – on GPU to label biopsy slides with the ISUP grading system using PyTorch with a test accuracy of 0.87 quadratic weighted kappa.

File encryption using face recognition
======
* Designed and developed face recognition programs to encrypt and decrypt files using OpenCV and Scikit-learn. 
* Used ResNet 10 SSD architecture to detect faces, FaceNet architecture to create 128D embeddings for each user from a sparse dataset of 5-6 images, and SVM for classification

Transfer Learning using DeepMimic
======
* Used DeepMimic to transfer learn different gaits of a humanoid for the ECE 239AS: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning class project. 
* Investigated the convergence of training networks from scratch and finetuning pretrained models. 
  
Numpy Deep Learning Framework
======
* Completed CS 231 assignments to build a deep learning framework from scratch using Numpy.
  
LED Lighting System
======
* Build a lighting system for my dorm room controlled using IR from my phone.
* Programmed Arduino Uno board in C++. 

Line-following Robot
======
* Built a line following car using TI microcontroller for ECE 3: Introduction to Electrical Engineering class project
* Implemented PID control in C++.
