  Advised by [Dr. Alex Wong]("http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~alexw/") and [Dr. Stefano Soatto]("http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~soatto/"). Interested in 3D vision and adversarial perturbations. 


## Work Experience 
### Undergraduate Research Assistant, Vision Lab (May'21 – Present) 
  *	Universal Adversarial Perturbation
      *	Building a framework to generate a single set of perturbations from a dataset for stereo matching networks generalizable across networks and datasets.
      *	Investigating architectural defenses to make networks robust to adversarial perturbations.
  *	Outlier Rejection
      *	Exploring networks for removing outliers from sparse depth maps generated using lidar. 
  *	Contributor, Xivo
      *	Adding bundle adjustment and triangulation to Xivo, visual inertial odometry system in C++.

### Undergraduate Research Assistant, Laboratory for Embedded Machines and Ubiquitous Robots (July'20 – April'21)
  *	Advised by Dr. Ankur Mehta.
  *	Tested 433 MHz LoRa, 2.4 GHz ESP32 WIFI, BLE, and 2.4 GHz NRF24l01 modules on latency and signal strength for communication with the blimp.
  *	Developed communication pipeline for manual control of lighter than air vehicles using ESP8266 microcontrollers and ESP Now protocol in python and C++. 
  *	Deployed on-device random forest and fully connected neural network models for image classification on ESP32 microcontrollers using TensorFlow lite.
  *	Implemented on-device monocular depth estimation on ESP EYE microcontroller. [Website]("https://uclalemur.com/people/parth-agrawal") [Blogpost]("https://uclalemur.com/blog/tag:foray")
