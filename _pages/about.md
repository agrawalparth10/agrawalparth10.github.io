## Work Experience 
* Undergraduate Research Assistant, Vision Lab (May 2021 – Present) 
  *	Advised by Dr. Alex Wong and Dr. Stefano Soatto
  *	I am interested in 3D vision and adversarial perturbations. 
  *	Universal Adversarial Perturbation
      *	Building a framework to generate a single set of perturbations from a dataset for stereo matching networks generalizable across networks and datasets.
      *	Investigating architectural defenses to make networks robust to adversarial perturbations.
  *	Outlier Rejection
      *	Exploring networks for removing outliers from sparse depth maps generated using lidar. 
  *	Contributor, Xivo
      *	Adding bundle adjustment and triangulation to Xivo, visual inertial odometry system in C++.

* Undergraduate Research Assistant, Laboratory for Embedded Machines and Ubiquitous Robots (LEMUR), (July 2020 – April 2021)
  *	Advised by Dr. Ankur Mehta.
  *	Tested 433 MHz LoRa, 2.4 GHz ESP32 WIFI, BLE, and 2.4 GHz NRF24l01 modules on latency and signal strength for communication with the blimp.
  *	Developed communication pipeline for manual control of lighter than air vehicles using ESP8266 microcontrollers and ESP Now protocol in python and C++. 
  *	Deployed on-device random forest and fully connected neural network models for image classification on ESP32 microcontrollers using TensorFlow lite.
  *	Implemented on-device monocular depth estimation on ESP EYE microcontroller.

* Computer Vision Intern, Tata Singapore Airlines (July’20 – September’20)
  *	Explored State-of-the-Art Face Recognition architectures for face recognition as part of DigiYatra, a Government of India program. 
  *	Developed a pipeline for handwritten text recognition to automate document processing using Tesseract. 

* Software Engineering Intern, Fuzzy Logix, (July 2019 – August 2019)
  *	Created framework to detect fraudulent transactions using graph algorithms. 
  *	Developed stored procedures in SQL to preprocess data, apply graph algorithms, and visualize the network.

* Kiosk Manager and Web Developer, UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame, (October 2019 – June 2020)
  * Provided technical support to the UCLA Athletics, Hall of Fame and maintained kiosk applications. 
  *	Actively fixed bugs, added test cases, and maintained database of student athletes using shell scripts, MySQL, and Swift. 
  *	Initiated the transition from legacy code to Swift 5.
